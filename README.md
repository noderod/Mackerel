## An Automated Writing Tool

Mackerel provides an automated, easy to use alternative for company or school
writing tasks. Simply provide the topic and/or files and we will do the rest.


### How it works
Mackerel is, at its core, a text summarizer based on [sumy](https://github.com/miso-belica/sumy).
It simply reorganizes the result into an usable product.
Current development is geared towards powerpoint presentations.
